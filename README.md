2. And on top of these amazing badges, get a chance to win some really cool Gooogle Cloud goodies*. üí™ (See Prize Rules section)


# Program's Syllabus

The program will introduce you to Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using Google Cloud's training platform called Qwiklabs where you will learn each of these topic using self-paced labs that provides you temporary credentials to Google Cloud Platform, so you can learn the cloud using the real thing ‚Äì no simulations.

For convinience, we have divided the topics above into 3 different tracks - starting from the most basic.
